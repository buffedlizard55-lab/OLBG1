# COORDINATION.md — Shared Task Board

**Read this before starting any work.** This file is the single source of truth for who is
working on what. It exists so that multiple agent sessions can work on this repository at the
same time without duplicating work or overwriting each other.

## 0. Conventions

### 0.1 Session IDs

A session ID is the Arena branch slug assigned to the session. The session that created this
board is **`arena/ce5920e3-olbg1`**, so its ID is **`ce5920e3-olbg1`**.

### 0.2 Branch naming — important deviation, read this

The project brief asks for per-task branches named `session-<id>/<task>`. Arena sessions in this
repository are **pinned to one sandbox-managed branch each**, and the agent operating a session
must not create, switch to, or push any other branch. Therefore:

* Each session works **only** on its own pinned `arena/<session-id>` branch.
* That branch is simultaneously the session's work branch **and** its integration branch.
* `main` is only ever advanced by the final integration session's merged pull request.

This is the one deliberate deviation from the brief. It removes the merge storms that per-task
branches would create while preserving the property the brief actually cares about: **no two
sessions write to the same files at the same time.**

### 0.3 Claiming a task

1. Add a row to the table in §1 with your session ID, your file scope and the UTC time.
2. Commit and push that claim **before** you start work.
3. Never start a task that another live session has claimed.

### 0.4 Scope rules

* Scopes must not overlap. If you need a file owned by another session, log a request in §4
  instead of editing it.
* Shared outputs (`site/index.html`, the site navigation, `data/index.json`) are written **only**
  by the final integration session.
* Commit small and often. `git pull --rebase` before every push.
* On a merge conflict: stop, resolve it so that **neither** session's work is discarded, and log
  it in §4.
* A claim with no commit for more than 60 minutes may be taken over by another session. Log the
  handoff in §4.

### 0.5 Verification rules (non-negotiable)

* Every data row must carry at least one link to an **official** source (the league, governing
  body, tour, promoter or team itself). Media outlets, aggregators and betting sites are **not**
  official sources.
* If a value cannot be confirmed from an official source: **leave it blank and flag it**. Never
  infer, interpolate or fill it in from memory.
* Model-derived values (our originated prices) are explicitly labelled as estimates and are never
  presented as sourced facts.
* Nothing is marked `verified` until the official source has actually been fetched and read.
